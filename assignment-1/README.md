# Assignment 1 : Simple HTML webpage

For this assignment, I learnt how to use Git within VSCode and created a simple webpage. I used HTML tags to neatly format the document and give a professional look. I also learnt how to use markdowns **_creatively_** alongside some cool VSCode extensions.


This webpage is a simple introductory _landing page_ for a generic business consulting company. It doesnt have any images and displays the **minimal basic details** for reachings its staff. I made a few changes to the front end to make the design look more appealing. I justified the paragraphs and added line breaks to make it easy to read the seperate modules. I also changed the alignment for the people who gave the testimonials since they were quoted directly. Finally, I changed the title as instructed.
