// Imports ProductRow component
// Maps our data model (represented as an object) to an array **
// Iterates through that array (.forEach()) and pushes a programmatically constructed <ProductRow> component to a temporary array. Call it ‘rows’ to makes things easy ***
// Renders a table. Table should contain headings and render out product row (now represented by rows array)
