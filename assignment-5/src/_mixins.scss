/*
Create at least 3 Sass mixins for all of the 
generic boxes including logo, 
navigation menu, header, 
content areas, and footer. 
Your mixins should also contain d
efault parameters for the properties that you are setting within the mixin.

Use a math operation somewhere in your code.

Create a mixin similar to the break() mixin that we built in the exercises. 
This mixin should handle the media queries for the web page.
All of the media queries within the page should also conform to Sass.
